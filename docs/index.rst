A Chemical Synthetic Route Cost Calculation Package
---------------------------------------------------

Welcome to the *costcalc2* documentation. This Python3 package provides tools
for calculating the raw material (RM) costs for chemical synthetic routes of
arbitrary complexity. There is also a `companion web application
<https://costcalc.rnelsonchem.com/>`_ that can be used to run these cost
calculations without writing any Python code. Because the web application is
the likely first entry point for new users looking to use this tool, the first
section below will provide details on creating properly formatted materials
and reactions tables in Excel, which can then be uploaded and processed in the
web app.
