# costcalc2

*costcalc2* is a Python library for calculating the overall raw materials costs 
of a user-defined synthetic route. 

## Requirements

* Python >= 3
* Numpy >= 1.0
* Pandas >= 1.0
* Matplotlib >= 3.0
* Openpyxl >= 3.0

# Web Application and Documentation

A minimal [working web application](https://costcalc.rnelsonchem.com/) is
available for running cost calculations without installing this package.
However, for users that are interested in writing programs using `costcalc2`,
there is an [annotated Jupyter
notebook](https://gist.github.com/rnelsonchem/5f38f9f6261591a158ed06c643fe09e7)
that demonstrates a common use case and most of the methods.
